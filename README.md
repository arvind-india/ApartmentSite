### Model View Controller (MVC) folder structure
![2017-05-20 2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22284225/26280625/5765e53c-3d91-11e7-8a5a-401d6a1a4be2.png)

### MODEL
Using the sequelize node module, models (tables) in the database were defined using sequelize.define('name', {attributes}, {options}) with appropriate DataTypes, Class Methods and Associations. Querying and accessing the database for CRUD (create, read, update, destroy) operations was executed via the Controller.

| Tables        | Associations              | Add'l Associations/Methods   |
| ------------- |:-------------------------:|:----------------------------:|
| User          |                           | Instance Valid Password      |
| WorkOrder     | belongsTo(models.Tenant)  | belongsTo(models.Contractor) |
| Tenant        | hasMany(models.WorkOrder) |                              |
| Contractor    | hasMany(models.WorkOrder) |                              |
| Prospect      |                           |                              |
| Applicant     |                           |                              |


### VIEW
Handlebars were implemented to dynamically generate views routed through the Controller. 
Partials, along with built-In Helpers of __each__, __if__ and __unless__ allowed specific delivery of blocks of code depending on routes.

### CONTROLLER
The Controller determines the appropriate action method to handle requests from the server. A multitude of HTTP requests for the manager functionality alone were needed to create, view, edit and delete data:
* GET Contractors

* POST Prospects

* PUT WorkOrders

### AUTHENTICATION
A registration form is delivered at the /signup path and displays a registration form which validates password by using regex. 
The Manager Login form is delivered via a modal, which authenticates user login by checking for existing username in the database (User model).
